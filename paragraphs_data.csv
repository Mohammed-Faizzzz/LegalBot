Introduction"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 1
The second plaintiff, Lim Thiam Chai (“Roland”) and his brother Lim 
Seong Ong (“Kenny”, the first plaintiff) were shareholders and directors of Asia 
Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd (“Asia Link”). Asia Link and the defendant 
(“Panshore”) entered into a joint venture on 1 March 2011, and Panshore 
became a shareholder of Asia Link at some point thereafter."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 2
On 7 September 2011, Panshore, Roland, and Kenny entered into an 
agreement (the “7 September 2011 agreement”) which was essentially a 
shareholders’ agreement between the three shareholders of Asia Link (ie, 
Panshore, Roland, and Kenny) regarding the affairs of Asia Link. An aspect of 
the 7 September 2011 agreement related to Panshore, Roland, and Kenny 
providing loans to Asia Link, to be used for the repayment of Asia Link’s “trade

debts”. Panshore was to lend Asia Link $1,000,000, Roland and Kenny (jointly) 
were to lend Asia Link $400,000. In the event, Panshore lent Asia Link the first 
$700,000 expected of Panshore, but Roland and Kenny did not lend Asia Link 
anything."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 3
Panshore’s counterclaim in this suit included a claim that Roland had 
breached the 7 September 2011 agreement by not lending Asia Link $400,000 
as he had promised. I granted Panshore interlocutory judgment on that claim for 
damages to be assessed, but dismissed Panshore’s other claims against Roland 
– my judgment on liability is [2023] SGHC 257. The present judgment deals 
with the assessment of damages.
Background
Joint venture"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 4
From 1 March 2011, Panshore and Asia Link were in a joint venture 
whereby Panshore would carry out marine offshore engineering work at Tuas 
Crescent (the “Premises”, which Asia Link had rented from Jurong Town 
Corporation (“JTC”)). Panshore and Asia Link were to share in the profits from 
projects completed at the Premises. Roland and Kenny were Asia Link’s 
directors and shareholders at the start of the joint venture."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 5
Asia Link was wound up on 1 March 2013, and Panshore left the 
Premises in April 2014.

7 September 2011 agreement"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 6
Clauses 1 and 2 of the 7 September 2011 agreement provided for 
Panshore, Roland, and Kenny to make loans to Asia Link:1
(a)
clause 1 stipulated that Panshore would provide a loan of 
$1,000,000 to Asia Link; and
(b)
clause 2 stipulated that Roland and Kenny would provide a loan 
of $400,000 to Asia Link."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 7
The loans were to be disbursed in three tranches: 2
(a)
the first tranche of $400,000 from Panshore, was said to have 
been “[a]lready disbursed on 9th June 2011”;
(b)
the second tranche comprised $300,000 from Panshore, and 
$200,000 from Roland and Kenny;
(c)
the third tranche comprised a further $300,000 from Panshore, 
and a further $200,000 from Roland and Kenny."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 8
Besides the first tranche payment of $400,000 (which the parties agreed 
had been disbursed), Panshore also lent Asia Link the $300,000 required of 
Panshore under the second tranche."

The reference in clause 3 to Asia Link’s “trade debts” states that they 
were “listed in Appendix A attached”, but that Appendix A was not in evidence. 
Panshore’s witness Mr Kang also said that when he signed the 7 September"

Roland’s breach of his contractual obligation to lend Asia Link $400,000"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 14
Kenny and Roland never lent Asia Link the sum of $400,000 (or any 
sum) pursuant to the 7 September 2011 agreement. I thus found Roland to be in 
breach of clause 2 of the agreement, and granted Panshore interlocutory 
judgment accordingly.

Damages claimed by Panshore"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 15
Panshore says that because Roland breached his obligation to lend 
$400,000 to Asia Link (which Panshore was in a joint venture with), Panshore 
suffered loss and damage for which Roland should compensate Panshore."

Panshore claims the following heads of damage:
(a)
$700,000 lent by Panshore to Asia Link;

Link from January 2012 to April 2014; and"

(c)
$422,170.26 as the value of Panshore’s assets left behind at the 
Premises.7"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 17
Panshore thus claims that because Roland failed to lend Asia Link 
$400,000, Panshore suffered losses of over $3m, for which it sought judgment 
against Roland.
Basis of Panshore’s claims"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 18
Panshore’s damages claims are built on the foundation that Roland’s 
breach caused Asia Link to be wound up.8 Panshore then says that because Asia 
Link was wound up:
(a)
Panshore was not repaid the $700,000 it lent Asia Link;
(b)
Panshore was not repaid the $1,958,993.68 in expenses that 
Panshore had paid on behalf of Asia Link; and
(c)
Panshore left behind $422,170.26 in assets when Asia Link’s 
liquidator required Panshore to leave the Premises."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 19
Panshore acknowledges that the damages it seeks must be causally 
connected to Roland’s breach, and must not be too remote: Out of the Box Pte 
Ltd v Wanin Industries Pte Ltd [2013] SGCA 15 at [10], [11], [17], and [47].9"

However, Panshore submits that instead of Panshore having to prove 
that Roland’s breach caused it loss, the burden lies on Roland to disprove this.10"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 21
I will address, in turn:
(a)
the burden of proof;
(b)
whether Roland’s breach caused Asia Link to be wound up; and 
if so
(c)
whether Panshore is entitled to the damages it claims.
Burden of proof"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 22
Panshore argues that it does not need to prove that Roland’s breach 
caused it loss; instead, it is for Roland to disprove this.11 Panshore argues that:
(a)
Roland’s breach of contract (ie, his breach of the 7 September"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 2011
agreement with Panshore) was also a breach of fiduciary duty 
owed to Asia Link, Roland being a director of Asia Link; and
(b)
in cases of breach of fiduciary duty, “the principal bears the legal 
burden of establishing its claim, but the legal burden of proof of showing 
that the loss would have been sustained by the principal even if the 
fiduciary had not breached his or her fiduciary duty falls on the 
fiduciary”: Sim Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and 
other appeals [2020] SGCA 35."

Lim Seong Ong v
[2024] SGHC 135
Panshore Engineering Pte Ltd"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 8
23
I do not agree that Panshore can reverse the burden of proving that 
Roland’s breach caused Panshore’s loss:
(a)
the claim for which damages are being assessed is a claim for 
breach of contract (owed to Panshore), not a claim for breach of 
fiduciary duty (owed to Asia Link); and
(b)
the breach of Roland’s contractual obligation (owed to Panshore) 
to lend Asia Link $400,000 was not also a breach of fiduciary duty 
Roland owed to Asia Link – as a director and fiduciary of Asia Link, 
Roland was not obliged to lend $400,000 (or any sum) to Asia Link; that 
obligation arose only because Roland contracted with Panshore to do so."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 24
The burden thus rests on Panshore to prove that Roland’s breach caused 
its loss. In any event, for the reasons set out below, even if the burden had rested 
on Roland to disprove a causal link between his breach and Panshore’s losses, 
the result would have been the same.
Did Roland’s breach cause Asia Link to be wound up?"

Asia Link was wound up on 1 March 2013 in Companies Winding Up"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 23
of 2013.12 The winding-up application was filed on 7 February 2013 by the 
Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and the Comptroller of Income 
Tax (“the Comptrollers”). The debts on which Asia Link was wound up totalled 
$808,585.21, comprising:"

which $629,520.13 was for income tax and the balance was for

[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 26
A statutory demand was served on 11 December 2012 but Asia Link did 
not pay or satisfy the demanded sum; nor did it respond to the winding-up 
application.14"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 27
Panshore submits that of the $700,000 which it lent Asia Link, the first 
loan of $400,000 was made “for the purposes of paying off Asia Link’s 
creditors, including [the Comptrollers] who filed for the liquidation of Asia 
Link.”15 Panshore further submits that Roland failed “to abide by his contractual 
obligations to furnish the share of $400,000 to the pool to pay Asia Link’s 
outstanding taxes and penalties imposed by [the Comptrollers]”;16 and that this 
caused Asia Link to be unable to pay its liabilities, which led to its winding up."

Panshore Engineering Pte Ltd"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 10
29
Clause 3 of the 7 September 2011 agreement stated that Asia Link was 
to use the loans (totalling $1,400,000: $1,000,000 from Panshore, $400,000 
from Roland and Kenny) for the repayment of Asia Link’s trade debts totalling 
$2,306,951.89 in a prescribed order: first to pay $611,418.87 in judgment debts, 
then $137,625.57 for legal cases, and finally $1,557,907.45 in respect of trade 
creditors (see: [10] above)."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 30
Based on the clause 3 framework, the $400,000 that Panshore lent to 
Asia Link was to be paid towards the $611,418.87 in judgment debts; it could 
not be used (as Panshore now suggests) for the purposes of paying off Asia 
Link’s creditors generally, including the Comptrollers."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 31
Applying Panshore’s $400,000 loan towards Asia Link’s judgment 
debts as required under the 7 September 2011 agreement would still leave a 
balance of $211,418.87 in judgment debts. That was to be cleared when the 
$500,000 second tranche of loans came in: $300,000 from Panshore, and 
$200,000 from Roland and Kenny."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 32
After the judgment debts had been paid off, there would still be a balance 
of $288,581.13 from the $500,000 second tranche loans, which would be 
sufficient to clear the $137,625.57 for legal cases. That would then leave 
$150,955.56 in funds to be paid towards the $1,557,907.45 in respect of trade 
creditors, reducing the amount owing to trade creditors to $1,406,951.89."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 33
When the $500,000 third tranche of loans came in (another $300,000 
from Panshore, and another $200,000 from Roland and Kenny), that would be 
paid towards the remaining $1,406,951.89 owing to trade creditors, reducing 
those debts to $906,951.89.

Panshore Engineering Pte Ltd"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 11
34
Based on the order stipulated in the 7 September 2011 agreement, if 
Roland had duly made the $400,000 loan, that would have gone towards Asia 
Link’s trade debts: judgment debts, legal cases, and amounts owing to trade 
creditors. No part of the $400,000 loan would have gone towards GST, income 
tax, and penalties, which is what Asia Link was wound up for not paying."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 35
GST, income tax, and penalties were not “trade debts” within the 7 
September 2011 agreement:
(a)
they were not judgment debts;
(b)
they were not in respect of legal cases; and
(c)
the Comptrollers were not trade creditors."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 36
Moreover, some of the GST, income tax, and penalties that were the 
subject of the winding-up application only arose after the 7 September 2011 
Agreement (which purported to list – in the missing “Appendix A” – the “trade 
debts” in question): those “trade debts” were present debts, not future debts."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 37
The loans from Panshore, Roland, and Kenny were never meant for 
future debts, they were expressly meant for debts that Asia Link was already 
owing, and even so the amounts loaned were not in themselves sufficient to pay 
off those debts: the $1,400,000 in loans under clauses 1and 2 would not have 
been sufficient to meet the full amount listed in clause 3 in respect of trade debts: 
there would remain over $900,000 owing to trade creditors."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 38
There is moreover no evidence that because Roland failed to lend Asia 
Link $400,000 as required under clause 2, Asia Link paid the corresponding 
amount (or part thereof) towards its trade debts from other funds (which

otherwise would have been used to pay Asia Link’s other expenses such as GST, 
income tax, and penalties). Indeed, there is no evidence that Asia Link paid 
anything towards its trade debts referred to in clause 3."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 39
Panshore has thus failed to prove that Roland’s breach in not lending 
Asia Link $400,000 caused Asia Link to be wound up. This is fatal to all of 
Panshore’s damages claims."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 40
I go on to consider if Panshore’s claims would also fail for other reasons.
Panshore’s claim for $700,000 that Panshore had lent Asia Link"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 41
Even if Roland’s breach had caused Asia Link to be wound up, it would 
not necessarily follow that that breach caused Panshore to lose the $700,000 
that it had lent Asia Link. That would depend on whether, with the $400,000 
loan from Roland, not only would Asia Link have avoided being wound up, but 
Asia Link would also have been able to repay Panshore the $700,000 that 
Panshore had lent. Panshore assumes this to be the case, but the evidence is that 
Asia Link was in serious financial difficulties. Mr Kang himself says:
(a)
“Without any meaningful number of foreign workers, Asia 
Link’s business came to a grinding halt by 2010. Asia Link was unable 
to complete its existing projects nor take on any new projects. Asia Link 
was in rapid operational and financial decline.”17"

(b)
“…by 2009 and 2010, Asia Link was clearly in financial decline 
and had no projects.”18 
(c)
“By early 2011, Asia Link was in dire financial straits. Asia Link 
had amassed significant debts and had several creditors on its tail.”19 
(d)
Asia Link’s balance sheet as at 30 June 2010 shows that it owed 
its trade creditors $4,532,945.41. That balance sheet shows that the 
$4,532,945.41 owed to trade creditors formed part of Asia Link’s current 
liabilities of $6,383,903.62, which exceeded its current assets of 
$5,038,686.45. 20"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 42
Even if Panshore could prove that Roland’s breach had caused Asia Link 
to be wound up, Panshore would still need to show that Asia Link would then 
have been able to repay Panshore’s loan of $700,000, notwithstanding Asia Link 
being in “dire financial straits”. Panshore’s submissions did not focus on this, 
and on the evidence I find that Panshore has not proved this. 
Panshore’s claim for $1,958,993.67 in expenses paid on behalf of Asia Link"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 43
The point above applies with even greater force (because of the larger 
sum involved) to Panshore’s claim for expenses paid on behalf of Asia Link. 
Panshore assumes that if Asia Link avoided being wound up, Asia Link would 
have been able to repay it the $1,958,993.67 which Panshore had paid as 
expenses on behalf of Asia Link. I find that Panshore has not proved this, given

Panshore’s decision to continuing paying Asia Link’s expenses even

a break in the chain of causation, such that Roland should not be held liable for 
Panshore failing to recover such “post joint venture” payments from Asia Link. 
This claim is moreover too remote: it was not in the reasonable contemplation

Panshore says it was only in 2014 that it found out that Asia Link had 
been wound up.23 This does not however justify Panshore continuing to use the 
Premises, and continuing to pay expenses, after the end of the joint venture."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 49
In its closing submissions, Panshore says that the joint venture 
agreement “could not be renewed due to Asia Link’s liquidation”.24 However, 
Asia Link was only wound up the day after the joint venture had ended (see [45] 
above). If the parties had wanted to renew the joint venture, they could have 
done so while the venture was still ongoing, but that did not happen. In any 
event, Panshore cannot blame the non-renewal of the joint venture on Asia 
Link’s winding-up, when Panshore’s own position is that it did not know about 
the winding-up until 2014 – on that premise, Panshore continued to use the 
Premises from March to December 2013, when it knew the joint venture had 
ended, but did nothing to extend it; Panshore then came to know about Asia 
Link’s winding-up in 2014."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 50
Even after Panshore came to know about Asia Link’s winding-up, 
Panshore continued to pay expenses on behalf of Asia Link (until April 2014), 
which it now includes in its claim against Roland. As with payments made after 
the expiry of the joint venture, payments made after Panshore knew of Asia 
Link’s winding up would be a break in the chain of causation, and would also 
be too remote to be recovered from Roland."

from January to April 2014 fails because the joint venture had ended, and also 
because Asia Link was in liquidation (and Panshore knew this).
Panshore’s claim for $422,170.26 as the value of Panshore’s assets left 
behind at the Premises."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 54
Panshore says it was compelled to leave behind $422,170.26 of assets at 
the Premises when it left in April 2014, because Asia Link’s liquidator, in 
breach of his duties as liquidator, refused to allow Panshore to remove those 
assets."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 55
First, as noted above (at [46], with the expiry of the joint venture at the 
end of February 2013, Panshore should have vacated the Premises by then. Had 
Panshore done so, its complaints about the liquidator requiring it to leave the 
Premises (and to leave assets behind) in March–April 2014 would not have 
happened. Indeed, if Panshore had vacated the Premises and removed its assets 
by the end of February 2013, Asia Link’s liquidator would not even have been 
appointed yet. Panshore’s conduct in continuing to use the Premises for more 
than a year after the joint venture had ended, is a break in the chain of causation, 
and renders too remote its claim for assets left behind at the Premises in April 
2014."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 56
Further, if Panshore were right in saying that it lost those assets because 
of the liquidator’s wrongful conduct, that too would have been a break in the 
chain of causation, and it would moreover be too remote to recover this loss 
from Roland.

Panshore did not merely allege wrongful conduct on the part of the 
liquidator, it in fact sued the liquidator in Suit 127 of 2016 (“Suit 127”) for him 
allegedly refusing to allow Panshore to remove its assets, in breach of his duties 
as liquidator. These allegations were denied by the liquidator. In the event, 
Panshore and the liquidator reached a settlement, and Suit 127 was 
discontinued."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 58
Notably, in Panshore’s statement of claim in Suit 127, the value of its 
assets left behind at the Premises was said to be $835,698.41,31 whereas in the 
present suit Panshore says it is $422,170.26."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 59
It is also worth noting that the liquidator’s position was that he had not 
refused to allow Panshore to remove its assets when Panshore left the Premises. 
In an affidavit dated 13 April 2016 in Asia Link’s winding up (which was refiled 
in Suit 127), the liquidator referred to a meeting he had with Mr Ng and one Mr 
David Tan on 2 April 2014 where they agreed that in consideration for Panshore 
being allowed to remove all of the items belonging to Panshore from the 
Premises, Panshore would pay Asia Link $150,000.32 In the afternoon of 2 April 
2014, Mr Ng sent the liquidator a list of items that Panshore wished to remove 
from the Premises, and the liquidator replied to say that he was agreeable to 
that, if Panshore paid Asia Link $150,000. Panshore made that payment, and 
removed the items.33 Thereafter, Panshore never requested the removal of any 
other items from the Premises, nor did Panshore allege that the liquidator had

Neither the liquidator, nor Mr Ng, nor Mr Tan, were witnesses in these 
assessment proceedings. Panshore’s sole witness was Mr Kang, who had no 
personal knowledge of the liquidator’s meetings or discussions with Mr Ng 
and/or Mr Tan, which Mr Kang was not a party to. Panshore thus relied on the 
contemporaneous emails to prove its allegation that the liquidator had 
wrongfully refused to allow Panshore to remove its assets from the Premises."

The email evidence in Mr Kang’s AEIC shows the following.

On 19 March 2014 the liquidator’s firm, Foo Kon Tan Grant

discussion later that day. Mr Ng attached a list of the assets, 
equipment, machinery, material, furniture, and other assets

Premises. Mr Ng asked to know “when we can remove all of our 
items” [emphasis added] from the Premises.37

On 2 April 2014, Mr Ng sent a further email to the 
liquidator, attaching “the list of items we would like to take 
out”.38

Later on 2 April 2014, the liquidator replied to Mr Ng to 
say, “[w]e are agreeable to you removing the items in the

allegation that, in breach of his duties as liquidator, the liquidator had 
wrongfully refused to allow Panshore to remove its assets from the Premises."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 63
Furthermore, if in April 2014 Panshore considered that it stood to lose 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets because of the liquidator’s wrongful 
conduct, why did it not promptly raise this with the liquidator, while the 
Premises were still under the liquidator’s control? Panshore left the Premises in 
April 2014, the JTC lease would expire at the end of 2015, yet Panshore only 
brought a claim against the liquidator for the supposed detention of its assets at 
the Premises on 5 February 2016, after the Premises had been returned to JTC. 
This is unreasonable conduct on Panshore’s part which breaks the chain of 
causation; moreover this makes any loss from Panshore not being able to 
retrieve its assets too remote to be recovered from Roland."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 64
In the circumstances, Panshore’s claim for the value of its assets left 
behind at the Premises fails not only because Roland’s breach did not cause Asia 
Link to be wound up, but also because:
(a)
Panshore should have vacated the Premises and removed all its 
assets by the end of February 2013;
(b)
if Panshore were right that the liquidator had wrongfully 
prevented it from removing its assets, that would be a break in the chain 
of causation, and such loss would be too remote to recover from Roland;

Panshore has failed to prove that the liquidator prevented it from 
removing its assets; and

Panshore failed to take reasonable steps to retrieve its assets 
before the Premises were returned to JTC.

Conclusion"
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 65
For the above reasons, I find that Panshore has failed to prove any loss 
that (a) was caused by Roland’s breach, and (b) is not too remote. It follows that 
Panshore is not entitled to substantial damages against Roland. I thus only award 
Panshore nominal damages of $10."
[2024] SGHC 135,"Para 66
In my judgment on liability, I reserved costs to this assessment stage. I 
had then observed that although Panshore had succeeded on liability for one of 
its claims (breach of contract by Roland), Panshore had failed on its other claim; 
moreover, it had yet to be determined whether Panshore would be awarded 
substantial or nominal damages. In the event, Panshore has only obtained 
nominal damages."

The parties are to file their submissions on costs, limited to ten pages 
(excluding any schedule of disbursements), within 21 days. Panshore is 
represented by lawyers and could seek legal costs. Roland is now self-
represented, but he was represented by lawyers earlier in these proceedings – he 
could seek legal costs for the period that he was represented by lawyers, and for 
the period that he has been self-represented he could seek compensatory costs 
pursuant to O 59 r 18A of the Rules of Court 2014, ie, such costs as would 
reasonably compensate him for the time expended by him, together with all 
expenses reasonably incurred.
